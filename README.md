# CMS

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/obduk/cms.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/obduk/cms)

A Content Management System (CMS) written with Ruby on Rails. Although it is a
working project, it was not created with the intention of being a production
system. Instead this has been my practice project over the years, used for
testing new ideas.

## Development

1. `./bin/setup` to set up the system
1. `./bin/test` to run all tests or `./bin/test spec/models/user_spec.rb` to run one test or folder
1. `./bin/quality` to run code quality checks
1. `./bin/run` to start services
1. http://localhost:3000/ to access the site
1. http://localhost:3000/graphiql to view GraphQL api
