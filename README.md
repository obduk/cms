# CMS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/obduk/cms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/obduk/cms)

A Content Management System (CMS) written with Ruby on Rails. Although it is a
working project, it was not created with the intention of being a production
system. Instead this has been my practice project over the years, used for
testing new ideas.
